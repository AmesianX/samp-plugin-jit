JIT 2.0 - 30/06/2013
====================

o Restructured code to allow multiple compiler backends (though there's only
  at the moment - asmjit)
o Added the OnJITCompile callback to let self-modifying code initialize itself
  before compilation begins
o Fixed server crash when running a gamemode that doesn't define main()
